# Project Objective:
The overarching objective of this study is to develop an ANN-based classification model capable of accurately categorizing different types of date fruits based on their external appearance features. By harnessing the power of machine learning, particularly ANNs, we aim to streamline and expedite the fruit classification process, reducing the dependency on manual expertise and minimizing the associated time and effort. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this model will facilitate enhanced efficiency and accuracy in fruit classification, benefiting stakeholders across the agricultural sector and contributing to the optimization of fruit production and distribution processes.
